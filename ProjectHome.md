<b>Persistence</b> has been implemented for the simplification and making easier the work with Core Data Framework and represents itsÂ light object wrapper. The project is inspired by the [kbucek](https://twitter.com/kbucek/) Persistence API framework built on Java

It is designed for the common usage scenarios, where it is sufficient the Core Data stack handling and the basic object (objects graph) querying or possibble using of projection for some of the attributes of the managed objects.

It covers the base Core Data Framework functionality by using  the common patterns: DAO (Data Access Object) and Factory.
